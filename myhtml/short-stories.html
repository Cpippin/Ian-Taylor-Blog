          <h5 class="card-title">Beauregaurd:</h5>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">The Beast</h6>
          <p class="card-text">I saved my family from a beast once. It's true, I really did. Like any other day, I awoke
            imagining it would be quiet, uneventful and just plain boring. Now that's not to say that seeing my family
            in danger is exciting for me, or that I dislike the quiet, much to the contrary. Nonetheless, when I need to
            protect those I love, I am relentless, and this situation was no different.</p>
          <p class="card-text">My brain could not decipher what exactly was going on. I knew that the noise was loud and
            seemed threatening, and there were children near by, but I had no clue what this thing was capable of, so I
            had to take action. I gathered a deep breath into my lungs and prepared to expel what was building in my
            vocal cords. With every yell, every cry, every bark of ferocity, the monster retreated. I had scared it, I
            wasn't sure why, or how, but I knew I had to continue. Again I lurched forward, exercising every fiber of my
            body to scare it back, scare it away from the helpless kids.</p>
          <p class="card-text">I was preparing to finish my barrage when the creature redoubled it's efforts and lunged
            back at me. I got a good look at the beast now. It was tall and slender with a hard dark red exterior. The
            bottom of it, where I assume the mouth must've been, was wider than the rest of the body. In a way
            resembling a hammerhead shark, with teeth just as ferocious. It made a loud noise that didn't ever stop for
            the duration of the battle. This pattern continued, it growling and lurching towards me, I yelling and
            jumping towards it. I could not muster the courage to actually make contact with it, and it seemed that this
            thing had the same apprehension, regardless, I still flinched every time it moved in my direction.</P>
          <p class="card-text">This went on for some time. A test of wills. As though I were the gods, and it the titans
            of ancient Greco mythology. There was no progression made for a long period of time, I began to grow weary.
            I retreated to the position of most importance, the children, for my final stand. When I got there, I was
            met with gratitude and reverence for my efforts, but the battle was not over.</p>
          <p class="card-text">
            As the creature drew nearer, I began to panic. What would happen if I could not protect this family? I
            decided not to think of the possibility. Instead I turned my fear into adrenaline and made my final assault
            on the tormentor. Finally, with my last bark, I drove the vacuum away.</p>

          <h5 class="card-trapped">Trapped:</h5>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">5 Second Prison</h6>
          <p class="card-text">Live mannequins<br> Every few minutes, change position, and hold again.<br> Brightly
            colored crepe streamers running down around them.<br> Holding drinks they never sip from.<br> Trying to
            blink as little as possible.</p>
          <p class="card-text">A man walks up to gaze.<br> Skin caked with dirt from some unknown place and fingernails
            full of everything he has held dear.<br> Pushing in passed the crowd and up to the glass, his eyes reveal
            years. Mysterious years that are half forgotten, bearing a heavy weight on his mind.<br> Why is he here?
            Maybe he doesn't even know. Out of place, or the most real representation of the human experience on the
            street?<br> He reaches his hand down, clutching the bottom of his shirt, and reveals his hairy abdomen to
            the unsuspecting pieces of art.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Surprised onlookers, gazing at the unabashed display, freeze waiting to see what will
            happen next.<br> None focused on the other man.</p>
          <p class="card-text">None but me.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Taking bold strides, he is a man of authority, or so he thinks. Pollo shirt tucked into
            his leather belted pants and black shoes to match, he wears a badge too insignificant to be memorable. His
            face solemn and solid like an unmoving sculpture in the side of a lonely mountain. His steps in perfect
            timing, as though he is listening to his favorite track and planning his movement accordingly.</p>
          <p class="card-text">By the time he makes it over to the would be stripper, everyone has noticed him. But eyes
            are on the dirty provocateur once again almost immediately.</p>
          <p class="card-text">His other hand up covering his heart, index finger and thumb traveling in a circular
            motion about his nipple.</p>
          <p class="card-text">The solemn looking man now looking angrily upon the spectacle, forcibly takes hold of the
            dirty mans wrist, pushing him away and onto the empty street.</p>
          <p class="card-text">The crowd resumes normal behavior.</p>
          <p class="card-text">And I am standing embarrassed on the street.</p>
